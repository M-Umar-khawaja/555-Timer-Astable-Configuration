# **555 Timer â€“ 20s Astable Configuration**  

This project is a **20-second timer** built using the **NE555 Timer IC** in **astable mode**. The circuit continuously generates a **HIGH-LOW pulse** with an approximate time period of **20 seconds**.  

## **Features**  
âœ… Uses **NE555 Timer** in astable mode  
âœ… Generates a **stable 20s pulse**  
âœ… Can be **modified for different time durations**  
âœ… Simple and easy to understand  

## **How It Works**  
- The **resistors (R1, R2) and capacitor (C1)** determine the **time period** of oscillation.  
- The output **automatically toggles** between HIGH and LOW.  
- This setup is useful for **blinking LEDs, clock pulses, and timing circuits**.  

## **How to Use**  
1. Open the **Proteus** simulation file.  
2. Run the simulation to observe the **20s output cycle**.  
3. Modify **R1, R2, or C1** to change the time duration.  

### **Need a Different Time?**  
Use the formula:  
\[
T = 0.693 (R1 + 2R2) C1
\]
